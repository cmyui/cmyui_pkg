Tools I find myself constantly rebuilding and reusing.

I enjoy writing things myself from a relatively low level, so while some of
these classes are simply inferior to using a 'real' lightweight framework, I
find that I learn much much quicker doing things on my own, and that I also
love the feeling of understanding exactly how everything works in my projects.

Note that I do releases on this package quite frequently and for relatively
small changes; this is because I often think of new ideas when writing other
projects and think they would be a nice addition to the library, but want to
use them immediately in my own code.
