Tools I find myself constantly rebuilding and reusing.

I enjoy writing things myself from a relatively low level, so while some of
these classes are simply inferior to using a 'real' lightweight framework, I
find that I learn much much quicker doing things on my own, and that I also
love the feeling of understanding exactly how everything works in my projects.
